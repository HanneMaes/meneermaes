# Run the Docker container: create and start a new container for a specific image
# Runs any default commands specified in the imageâ€™s CMD or ENTRYPOINT
sudo docker run -p 4000:4000 -v $(pwd):/app meneermaes-jekyll

# bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl "" --watch --livereload
   # --baseurl "": added because when linking my meneermaes.be domain I had to change to baseurl to "" in _config.yml, and now it only works locally when I add --baseurl ""
   # --watch: watch for changes and automatically rebuild the site
   # --livereload: automatically refresh the browser
